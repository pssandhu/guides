# Installing NewPipe

## From F-Droid

NewPipe can be [installed from F-Droid](./f-droid#installing-apps-from-f-droid) like other apps. [This link](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/) should take you to the appropriate page in F-Droid.

## Using NewPipe's F-Droid Repository

NewPipe's F-Droid repository allows updates to NewPipe to be available sooner than on the default F-Droid repository. This is also useful if you are having issues with the default version of NewPipe. The [official instructions](https://newpipe.net/FAQ/tutorials/install-add-fdroid-repo/) explain how to do this.
