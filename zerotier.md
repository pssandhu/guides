# Getting Your Connection Accepted

Your network administrator may need to accept your connection to the network. Find out by asking them. If so, they will need your Node ID.

## Finding Your Node ID

### macOS or Windows

1. Open the ZeroTier menu
2. Your Node ID should be displayed
3. Make note of it

### Android or iOS

Find your Node ID in the status bar at the bottom of the main app screen, as shown below:

# Checking You're Connected and Reconnecting

## macOS or Windows

1. Open the ZeroTier menu to see all the networks you've added
2. If the network does not have a tick next to it, it's disconnected. Click on the network to join it

## Android or iOS

1. Open the main screen of the ZeroTier app
2. Make sure the switch next to the network name on the main screen is turned on
3. If you have successfully connected, the message in the status bar of the app should say "Online"

The screenshot above shows the app screen with a successfully connected network.

If you are connected, your device should also indicate that you're connected to a VPN.
